//ESP32S3 based Weather Station project. 
//Uses wifi library, connects with static Wifi Credentials to gather Clock Time, and then OpenWeather API Key
//OpenWeatherAPI free key, project based on using free key so that project can be entirely free with hardware of an esp32 and LCD. or using Waveshare esp32s3, 1.9"
//Each function works independantly, such as scrolling, clock time from wifi, openweather api key grab, LeftBoxUtils box rendering
//feel free to grab certain helper files, implement them on your project one by one.
//Enjoy!
